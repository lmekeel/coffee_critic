# Coffee Critic
I started this app as a project for school but never finished. It needs a lot of restructuring and additions!\
I welcome anyone who would like to make changes/updates to this project! Feel free to send me a message or make a pull request.

# Description/App Idea
The purpose of this app is to locate local coffee shops (filtering out big chains like Starbucks etc.) in the user's area.\
Currently, the app uses Google Maps API to display the map, but there is not much logic added yet.
When the user selects a marker, other user's reviews should show up under the map. 
The user should be able to favorite coffee shops they have been to or want to try and add their own reviews.
